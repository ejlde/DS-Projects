# What is machine learning?
# Teaching a cp how to learn based on data

## Supervised Learning
# input cats and dogs - 
# watch if cp returns cat and dog correctly

## Unsupervised Learning
# Input weight - height graph
# No classifications - look for patterns
# CP returns clusters of data w/o labels

## Reinforced Learning
# Agents and environments
# Assign points for cp performing desired actions
